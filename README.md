Problem statement
A retail company 'ABC privated limited' wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specially ,purchase amount) against various products of different categories .They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.The data set also contains customer demographics (age,gender,marital status,city type,stay in current city )product details(product id,product category) and total purchase amount from last month.

Now they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against the products which will help them to create perosnalised offer for customers against different products.
